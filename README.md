# tindART

We are cwru students. We are making tinder for art. Built for HackCWRU 2020. Built using React Native + Expo

“Art washes away from the soul the dust of everyday life”
~ Pablo Picasso :older_man:

## Getting Started

1) cd .\tindart_2\
2) npm install -g expo-cli
3) npm install
4) expo start

## How it Works

Art is presented to a viewer one piece at a time
The user has time to look at the art and read about its origin and description
User can then swipe right if they like the piece of art or left if they no not
